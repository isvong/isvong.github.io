    <h1>hello!</h1>
    <i>this website is under construction &#58;&#41;</i>
    <p>but for now, here's a small tidbit about me:</p>
    <p>my name is isabella vong, an undergraduate student (3rd year) at the university of michigan studying computer
        science with a
        minor in digital studies.</p>
    <p>i have a wide variety of interests that all stem from the interaction between technology and society. however, my
        main interests lie in security and privacy, digital culture and history, and social justice (still broad, i know
        haha). i am very much a complete beginner in all of my fields and i'm slowly working towards becoming an
        amateur.</p>

    <p>i am currently learning about the history of the World Wide Web and Internet which has prompted me into coding a
        website from scratch. in addition to looking into these histories i am also studying the history of security and
        tech ethics. when i'm not juggling all of my interests i am trying to go through my long long reading list while
        struggling to organize all the information in my life. </p>

    <p>thanks for taking some time to read about me, you can reach out to me at the email below!</p>
