            <b>about</b>
            <p>my name is Isabella Vong (she/they) a 3rd year undergraduate at the university of michigan where i double
                major in computer science and <i>prospectively</i> american culture/ethnic studies alongside a minor in
                digital studies. i am interested in the intersection of race, society, and technology. </p>

            <p>i am curious about the staggered experiences in contemporary computing, specifically in the marginalized
                and/or displaced. i also have a special interest in social movements and the modern role of
                technology in relation to greater social efforts.</p>

            <b>words</b>
            <p>“I hope you live without the need to dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never
                victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you fail, and are defeated, and in
                pain, and in the dark, then I hope you will remember that darkness is your country, where you live,
                where no wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is. Our roots are in the dark; the
                earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing — instead of around, and down? What hope we have
                lies there. Not in the sky full of orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down
                upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but in the dark that nourishes,
                where human beings grow human souls.” - Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
