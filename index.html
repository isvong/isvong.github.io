        <p>but for now, here's a small tidbit about me:</p>
        <p>my name is <b>isabella</b>, an undergraduate student (3rd year) at the university of michigan studying
            computer
            science with a
            minor in digital studies.</p>
        <p>i have a wide variety of interests that all stem from the interaction between technology and society.
            however, my
            main focus lies in the histories and methods of "non-mainstream" and/or marginalized groups online. i am
            intrigued by the dimensions and formations of "tech culture," specifically of the ideals of a democratized
            and open
            Internet, created through the community and user effort. </p>

        <p>i am currently learning about the origins of the World Wide Web and Internet which has prompted me into
            coding a
            website from scratch. </p>

        <p>thanks for taking some time to read about me, you can reach out to me at the email below! i especially love
            getting book and video essay reccommendations. :) </p>
