            <p></p><i>this website is under construction &#58;&#41;</i></p>
            <p>but for now, here's a small tidbit about me:</p>
            <p>my name is <b>isabella</b>, an undergraduate student (3rd year) at the university of michigan studying
                computer
                science with a
                minor in digital studies.</p>
            <p>i have a wide variety of interests that all stem from the interaction between technology and society.
                however, my
                main focus lies in the histories and methods of "non-mainstream" and/or marginalized groups online. i am
                intrigued by the dimensions and formations of "tech culture," specifically of the ideals of a
                democratized
                and open
                Internet, created through the community and user effort. i would like to think of myself as an advocate
                for
                creativity. </p>

            <p>i am currently learning about the origins of the World Wide Web and Internet which has prompted me into
                coding a
                website from scratch. </p>

            <p>thanks for taking some time to read about me, you can reach out to me at the email below! i especially
                love
                getting book and video essay reccommendations. :) </p>
