            <p><i><mark>this website is under construction </mark></i></p>
            <p>but for now, here's a small tidbit about me:</p>

            <b>about</b>

            <p>my name is <i>isabella (she/they)</i>, a 3rd year undergraduate at the university of michigan
                studying
                computer
                science with a
                minor in digital studies.</p>

            <b>interests</b>

            <p>my current focus lies in the histories and methods of "non-mainstream" and/or marginalized groups online
            </p>

            <p> i am intrigued by:
            <ul>
                <li> the obfuscation and neglect of these groups / the
                    overcoming of these barriers in making these groups visible </li>
                <li> the dimensions and formations of "web culture," specifically of the ideals of a democratized and
                    open
                    Internet, created through communities and user effort. </li>
                <li> the complexities in the use of technology for social good </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>i like to explore these topics through:
            <ul>
                <li>interactive storytelling</li>
                <li>longform journalism/formal blogging</li>
                <li>formal research and the development of tools (applications/programs)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>i would like to think of myself as an advocate for thought and creativity. i wholeheartedly believe the
                internet should be a free and open resource in which everyone is able to access information.</p>

            <b>at the moment</b>

            <p>9/25 - i am currently learning about the origins of the World Wide Web and Internet which has prompted me
                into
                coding a
                <a href="https://www.htmlhobbyist.com/">website from scratch</a>.
            </p>

            <b> :) </b>

            <p>thanks for taking some time to read about me, you can reach out to me at the email below! i am still very
                much an amateur in my domains of interests and i always enjoy conversing about them. i especially
                love getting reading reccommendations.
            </p>
